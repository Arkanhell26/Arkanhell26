## Sobre mi:

I am a recently graduated Software Development Technician, with knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a more advanced understanding of Java, SQL, and GitHub. Although my experience with object-oriented programming is still developing, I am focused on continuing to learn and specializing in backend development.

I consider myself a creative person with an analytical mindset and a strong focus on problem-solving. I enjoy tackling technical challenges, learning new technologies, and working collaboratively. I also perform well under pressure and have the ability to understand English documentation and resources, which allows me to stay up-to-date and keep growing professionally.

I am always looking for opportunities to grow, contribute to real-world projects, and strengthen my software development skills.
